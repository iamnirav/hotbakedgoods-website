    <h3>About the band</h3>
    <p>The Hot Baked Goods was founded in October 2012 on a concrete staircase on the west side of Dolores Park by a
      small group of swing dancer friends. They worked up their chops playing for passing MUNI trains and rehearsing in
      the living room of Bay Area traditional jazz guru Clint Baker. Over time, the band moved their practice to a more
      central location in the park where friends came to dance, eat, and enjoy San Francisco culture. They played near
      the playground almost every Saturday for a year and a half. Children clapped, wiggled, and giggled, neighborhood
      parents asked them to play for their kid’s birthday parties; it was a joyous time.</p>
    <p>The ‘Goods look forward to learning and growing as musicians, and friends, with each passing year. They’re
      endlessly grateful to their long-standing regular fans and new ones alike, and hope to see you at a dance or party
      soon!</p>
    <p>Available for hire as a 4 to 7 piece band, The Hot Baked Goods play for a variety of events including weddings,
      corporate parties, dance events, and more. They travel nationally and internationally, spreading their love of
      jazz everywhere they go. Excitement, passion, and respect for the music continue to ignite them, like in their
      early days, so you can be sure they will bring hot energy to the stage whenever they perform. You can catch them
      regularly at Amnesia on the first, third, and fifth Sundays of each month from 6 to 9pm, and at local Bay Area
      swing dances. Be sure to check their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/thehotbakedgoods">Facebook

        <p>Bay Area vocalist and instrumentalist <strong>Jessica King</strong> discovered her passion for jazz through
          an introduction to Lindy Hop swing dancing in 2010 in Philadelphia. Dance has taken her to places she never
          dreamed, but always hoped, including the stage. Co-creator of The Hot Baked Goods, she sings and plays
          rhythm—washboard, guitar, and banjo—with multiple bands in the Bay and beyond. Since she was a girl, blues,
          jazz, and R&amp;B have been ever-present in her musical tastes. Growing up, she found vocal inspiration
          listening to Nat Cole, Patsy Cline, Aretha Franklin, Lauryn Hill, and Robert Plant, and in more recent years,
          Una Mae Carlisle, Peggy Lee, Bessie Smith, Anita O'Day, and local great Barbara Dane. Experienced as a lead
          vocalist, Jessica also loves to collaborate on harmonies with other singers and as a backup vocalist. When
          she’s not on stage, you can find her developing recipes in her kitchen, <a href="https://www.920special.com/"

        <p><strong>Riley Baker</strong> was raised in a musical household with his mother in jazz radio and father a
          musician. He picked up the drums when he was about 6 years old and by 12 was playing professionally with his
          father’s jazz band and the early Hot Baked Goods band. In middle school, he started playing the tuba and other
          instruments on which he became very proficient. While in high school, Riley played drums with The Hot Baked
          Goods, Clint Baker’s Golden Gate Swing Band, and performed on tuba with the Oakland Symphony Youth Orchestra,
          the San Francisco Symphony Youth Orchestra, and the Young People’s Symphony Orchestra. Riley also appears
          occasionally with Rob Reich’s “Swings Left”, the Circus Bella All-Star Band, Adam Theis’s Jazz Mafia, and
          other groups around the Bay Area and in Los Angeles. Riley is currently attending the California State
          University Northridge School of Music in Northern Los Angeles.</p>

        <p><strong>Andrew “Carnegie” Hall</strong> has enjoyed playing with The Hot Baked Goods since 2015 and is a
          lifelong learner of music. Carnegie is committed to educating his students in music and social emotional
          learning while keeping an open mind and learning along with them. His principal instrument is the piano but
          Carnegie also enjoys playing the guitar, tenor guitar and banjo, upright bass, pipe organ, and singing. While
          he finds much fulfillment in music, Carnegie is also an avid and active sailor on the San Francisco Bay. If
          he's not at a gig, teaching, or sailing, you will probably find Carnegie enjoying some peace in the beautiful
          natural areas of the Bay Area or enjoying a home cooked meal with a nice glass of wine.</p>
