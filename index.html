    <h2>The Hot Baked Goods play dance music from the 1920s and ’30s</h2>
    <p>The Hot Baked Goods is an energetic band of jazz musicians playing hot tunes primarily from the 1920s–30s. Many
      of the band members started as swing dancers, and fell so in love with the music that they learned to make it
      themselves!</p>
